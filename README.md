# Toad

Welcome to the Toad repository!

This repository is currently private.
If you are here, it is because you had a personal invite from me, and I value your opinion.
I'm looking for early feedback, and potential collaboration in the future (if you're interested).

I am particularly interested in your feedback on usability right now.
This class of apps is so new, I think there is plenty of room for innovation.

Please use the Discussions tab for your feedback.
Avoid issues and PRs for now, unless we've agreed on them in the Discussions tab.
I am working quite fast, and chances are I am aware of most of the issues.

Toad is very much a work in progress.
See [notes.md](https://github.com/Textualize/toad/blob/main/notes.md) for details about what to expect.

## What is Toad?

Toad is a universal interface to AI agents, which includes chat bots and agentic coding.
Here's a tongue-in-check write up on my blog: https://willmcgugan.github.io/announcing-toad/

## Talk about Toad!

Please **do** talk about Toad!
Generating a buzz ahead of the first open release will be very beneficial.

You may share your thoughts on social media in addition to screenshots and videos (but obviously no code from this repository). please use the hashtag `#toad`.

I intend to release a first public version when there is enough core functionality.
Progress has been good. So I would expect a release in December.

## Requirements

Works on Linux and Mac. Windows support may lag behind, but will catch up.

Any terminal will work, although if you are using the default terminal on macOS you will get a much reduced experience.
I recommend [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) which is fully featured and has amazing performance.

## Getting started

Assuming you have [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed, running `toad` should be as simple as cloning the repository and running the following:

```
uv run toad
```

There will eventually be a nice UI for selecting your agent.
For now you will need to specify an agent on the command line (see below).

You should also specify a project directory with the `--project-dir` option. Here's an example:

```
uv run toad acp "gemini --experimental-acp" --project-dir ~/sandbox
```

## Installing agents

Agents need to be installed separately, and require support for [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction).

You will need to install the agent and authenticate at least once with the agent's own CLI tool.
After that you can use Toad to interact with it.

### Gemini

Gemini has ACP support out of the box:

```
uv run toad acp "gemini --experimental-acp"
```

### Claude

Claude requires installation of [claude-code-acp](https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp) plus claude cli itself. Once installed, run:

```
uv run toad acp "claude-code-acp"
```

### Codex

Codex requires [codex-acp](https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp). Once installed, run:

```
uv run toad acp "codex-acp"
```

### Other agents

There are other agents that support ACP.
Replace the command to launch them as above and they should work.

## Thanks

Thanks for being a part of this!

See you in discussions.

I'm also in the #toad channel on the [Textualize discord server](https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr).
